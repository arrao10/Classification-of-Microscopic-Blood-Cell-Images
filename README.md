### üìñ **Introduction**: 
Accurate classification of cells in peripheral blood smears is critical for diagnosing hematological diseases. This project develops and evaluates deep learning models‚Äîcentered on modern **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify microscopic blood cells by morphology into **8** categories: **Neutrophils**, **Eosinophils**, **Basophils**, **Lymphocytes**, **Monocytes**, **Immature Granulocytes**, **Erythroblasts** and **Platelets**. The objectives is a benchmark for model performance and is effective, reproducible practices for data preparation, architecture selection, training and evaluation. By leveraging high-quality image data and automated inference, the system aims to improve accuracy and efficiency, streamline routine review and support timely, precise clinical decision-making.

* **Resolution**: All images are uniform **360 √ó 361 pixels**.

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Class Imbalance Addressed with Weight Random Sampling**:
Weighted random sampling ensures that samples from underrepresented classes are more likely to be chosen during training by assigning higher sampling weights to these classes.

**Uses of Weight Random Sampling**: 
  - Balances class distribution in the training process when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
  - Prevents the model from being biased toward overrepresented classes.
  - Ensures each class contributes equally during training, improving model performance across all classes.
  - Weighted random sampling is applied only on Training dataset because the test dataset should reflect the real-world class distribution for an unbiased evaluation.
